Questions that we formed throughout the code

- Is there a relationship between education and spending habits? (ML)
We assume that as people get older they will spend more money on their appearance and socializing.
At what point in people's lives do they start to save the most amount of money? "I save all the money I can" from spending habits

BEN STUFF DEMOGRAPHIC - VILLAGE OR CITY 
Another area of interest would be for us to study the difference in experiences of people that live in cities vs villages. 
- I spent most of my childhood in a :  "Village - town" 
My hypothesis would be that people that grew up in a town had greater interest/hobbies in academic subjects such as: 
- history, math, physics, chemistry, pc software more than people that grew up in villages. 
********-How much time do people spend online (LINE 57 personality traits section) *********
Also, animal suffering. (Line 22). Which of these two demographics would be most affected regarding a PETA commercial?
- who would donate more?

My next hypothesis would be that people that grew up in villages have different fears than people that grew up in towns.
- If so, do people have who grew up in villages fear certain things less? Do villagers fear things like darkness, spiders, rats less?
- I would predict Yes, but we should explore that. 
- between city vs. village people
- personality traits== 4. I often study or work even in my spare time.
        - 7. I am reliable at work and always complete all tasks given to me
        - 55. I always listen to my parents' advice.
        - 14. I take my time to make decisions.
- do people save more money from the city or village?
- who have the better degrees???

MATT'S SECTION HEALTHY DEMOGRAPHIC - SMOKERS/NONSMOKERS
What are the hobbies/interests of people that are healthy? What about for smokers? As a marketing firm we want to know these things,
so we can pair their interests into a marketing plan. 
- Are healthy people interested in academics? What about Adrenaline sports? (quite possibly - #31) Do they play sports at a 
leisure/competetive level? (23/24) If so, we could gear sports related ads towards them. 
- What about spending habits on good quality food? (assume for non-smokers/ healthy people that yes.)
For smokers
- Do they drink as well? ( I would assume yes)
- Are they interested in sports too? (23/24) (assume probably not)
- for spending habits on good quality food? 

* YOU ALREADY KINDA DID THIS STUFF *
In Health Habits- I live a very healthy life style - we should also see that they also will happily pay more money for food
- column names "healthy eating" vs"spending on healthy food"
-Do people with smoking habits believe, "I live a very healthy lifestyle?"
    -Do people with drinking habits believe, "I live a very healthy lifestyle?"
    -Are these people worry about their health?
