so we can pair their interests into a marketing plan. 
- Are healthy people interested in academics? What about Adrenaline sports? (quite possibly - #31) Do they play sports at a 
leisure/competetive level? (23/24) If so, we could gear sports related ads towards them. 
- What about spending habits on good quality food? (assume for non-smokers/ healthy people that yes.)
For smokers
