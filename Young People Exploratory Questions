Questions that we formed throughout the code

- What is the range between male and female heights? 
    -Also do some research on heights of Slovakian people ** 
- What is the min and max of these heights and are there any outlier we should remove? Yes, 62 cm female
~~~ age distribution? ~~~
-Do people with smoking habits believe, "I live a very healthy lifestyle?"
    -Do people with drinking habits believe, "I live a very healthy lifestyle?"
    -Are these people worry about their health?

- Is there a relationship between education and spending habits? (ML)
We assume that as people get older they will spend more money on their appearance and socializing.
At what point in people's lives do they start to save the most amount of money? "I save all the money I can" from spending habits
- more specifically you could examine what education level, as well as age ranges. and then based on the range we can also undertand 
  what education level
If I were a retailer or business, which demographic would I choose to advertise my products for? 
- Which demoraphic spends more on gadgets? Which demographic spends more on branded vs non branded clothing.
- columns - "spending on gadgets" and "spending on looks"
In Health Habits- I live a very healthy life style - we should also see that they also will happily pay more money for food
- column names "healthy eating" vs"spending on healthy food"

- between city vs. village people
- personality traits== 4. I often study or work even in my spare time.
        - 7. I am reliable at work and always complete all tasks given to me
        - 55. I always listen to my parents' advice.
        - 14. I take my time to make decisions.
- do people save more money from the city or village?
- who have the better degrees???

~ connect back to why this is important, perhaps in learning which

-Are people that are interested in one STEM topic also interested in other STEM topics? (JT)
-Are people that are interested in one humanities topic also interested in other humanities topics?
-i.e. Are people that are interested in Mathematics and Physics also interested in Biology and Chemistry?
-i.e. Are people that are interested in History and Poetry Reading also interested in Theatre, Art, and Religion?


Another area of interest would be for us to study the difference in experiences of people that live in cities vs villages. (ML)
- I spent most of my childhood in a :  "Village - town" 
My hypothesis would be that people that grew up in a town had greater interest/hobbies in academic subjects such as: 
- history, math, physics, chemistry, pc software more than people that grew up in villages. 
My next hypothesis would be that people that grew up in villages have different fears than people that grew up in towns.
- If so, do people have who grew up in villages fear certain things less? Do villagers fear things like darkness, spiders, rats less?
- I would predict Yes, but we should explore that. 

If I were an retailer or business, which demographic would I choose to advertise my products for? 
- Which demoraphic spends more on gadgets? Which demographic spends more on branded vs non branded clothing. 

*-Is there a possible relationship with people's preferences in music or movies and phobias? or perhaps different phobias 
I hypothesize that people who are into slowpaced music/mild hearted movies have more phobias, and perhaps are more scared of many things than others.

Do people who enjoy slow paced music have a heightened level of phobia? Perhaps there is a psychological explanation for this
- generalize phobias as a whole and then compare different types of music to it, heavy metal/opera/jazz/pop
    - can probably average out the total phobias category for each person (facet over male/female maybe too), box plot across different types of movies/music

do people who watch horrors and thrillers have a higher phobia of public speaking vs. people who like horrors, sci-fi movies, or documentaries???
- here I am hypothesizing that people who watch horror or documentaries are more introverted than others, maybe it'll have an interesting set of correlations


What are the hobbies/interests of people that are healthy? What about for smokers? As a marketing firm we want to know these things,
so we can pair their interests into a marketing plan. 
- Are healthy people interested in academics? What about Adrenaline sports? (quite possibly - #31) Do they play sports at a 
leisure/competetive level? (23/24) If so, we could gear sports related ads towards them. 
- What about spending habits on good quality food? (assume for non-smokers/ healthy people that yes.)
For smokers
- Do they drink as well? ( I would assume yes)
- Are they interested in sports too? (23/24) (assume probably not)
- for spending habits on good quality food?
