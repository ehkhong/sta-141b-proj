Questions that we formed throughout the code

-Do people with smoking habits believe, "I live a very healthy lifestyle?"
    -Do people with drinking habits believe, "I live a very healthy lifestyle?"
    -Are these people worry about their health?

- Is there a relationship between education and spending habits? (ML)
We assume that as people get older they will spend more money on their appearance and socializing.
At what point in people's lives do they start to save the most amount of money? "I save all the money I can" from spending habits
- more specifically you could examine what education level, as well as age ranges. and then based on the range we can also undertand 
  what education level
If I were a retailer or business, which demographic would I choose to advertise my products for? 
- Which demoraphic spends more on gadgets? Which demographic spends more on branded vs non branded clothing.
- columns - "spending on gadgets" and "spending on looks"

-Are people that are interested in one STEM topic also interested in other STEM topics? (JT)

-i.e. Are people that are interested in Mathematics and Physics also interested in Biology and Chemistry?
-i.e. Are people that are interested in History and Poetry Reading also interested in Theatre, Art, and Religion?


Another area of interest would be for us to study the difference in experiences of people that live in cities vs villages. (ML)
- I spent most of my childhood in a :  "Village - town" 
My hypothesis would be that people that grew up in a town had greater interest/hobbies in academic subjects such as: 
- history, math, physics, chemistry, pc software more than people that grew up in villages.
